## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a dynamic application built to provide users with real-time weather data and forecasts. The project was built to be a user-friendly platform that offers reliable weather predictions that are useful for planning things such as day-to-day activities or travel. 

The dashboard simplifies weather information by integrating current conditions and a 5-day forecast into a single interface, leveraging OpenWeatherMap's API data to deliver timely updates. The development process enhanced my proficiency in API integration and frontend development, particularly in ensuring accurate time zone conversions for global usability.

## Project Background
This project was created entirely from scratch as part of my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. It is intended as a hands-on exercise in creating a dynamic web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs, Third-Party APIs, and Server-Side APIs.

## Deployed Application
The deployed application can be viewed here: [https://ktotah.github.io/ktotah-weather-dashboard/](https://ktotah.github.io/ktotah-weather-dashboard/)

## Usage
To use the Weather Dashboard, simply follow these steps:

1. Enter the name of the city in the search bar and click the 'Search' button. 

2. View the current weather conditions for the selected city, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, along with the date and a representative weather icon. 

3. Look below the current weather display to see a 5-day forecast with daily summaries.

4. For quick access in the future, your past seven searches will be saved under the search bar. Click on any city name in your search hisotry to revisit that city's weather data. 

5. Use the 'Clear Search History' button to reset your search history if needed. 

The application is designed to be intuitive, with a clean and polished user interface that ensures an enjoyable and straightfoward experience. 

## Screenshot

Below is a **screenshot** of the deployed application, featuring Seattle's current weather conditions including temperature, wind speed, and humity, alongside a 5-day weather forecase with each day's expected conditions. The interface also presents a search area for city queries and a list of previously searched cities as buttons for quick access:

Below, a 5-day forecast presents weather predicitons from January 31 to February 4. On the left-hand side, a search interface allows city lookups, and a hisotry of searched cities are presented as a list of buttons for quick access to searched cities like Anchorage, Honolulu, and Denver.](assets/media/screenshot.png)


## Testing

To ensure the Weather Dashboard operates flawlessly, the following tests were conducted:

1. Checked that the city search function retrieves the correct weather data and updates the display accordingly. 

2. Validated that the current weather conditions include all necessary data points and that the date and icons are correct. 

3. Tested the 5-day forecast for accuracy and completeness, ensuring each day is represented with the correct date and weather summary. 

4. Confirmed that the search history is properly recorded and accessible, with the ability to revisit previous searches with a single click.

5. Tested the 'Clear Search History' feature to ensure it resets the history as expected.

6. Assessed the responsive design on various devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and functional layout across all platforms.

Every feature was repeatedly tested to confirm reliability and responsiveness, guaranteeing a seamless user experience.
